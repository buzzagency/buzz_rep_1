Website copy should speak directly to your customers without the jargon.

Your website is your virtual sales team, the shop front to your customers, therefore good website copy must be easy to read, easy to assimilate and easy to move around in.

It is a fact that text is harder to read on screen than on paper and readers tend to scan for information, so your copy content should be delivered in byte size pieces with relevant headings, it should answer the buying objections of the reader and convince them that your product or service is exactly what they need driving them to take action via telephone, contact form, appointment or to buy.

We write copy that talks directly to your customers, structured to provide the reader with a good experience, delivering the right tone of voice that mirrors your brands personality and sells the benefits in an engaging and persuasive manner.

To keep customers coming back to your website it’s important to provide a great customer experience that delivers a great customer service that puts your business head and shoulders above your competitors.

The following list is an example of just some of the additional content that can enhance your website , customer experience and search engine rankings:
