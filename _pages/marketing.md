<strong>Content; the present and future of marketing.
</strong>
There is traditional marketing and there is content marketing, but what is content marketing?
<blockquote>Content marketing is a strategic marketing approach focused on creating and distributing valuable, relevant, and consistent content to attract and retain a clearly-defined audience — and, ultimately, to drive profitable customer action.</blockquote>
Basically, content marketing is the art of communicating with your customers and prospects without selling.

With traditional marketing becoming less effective many companies are turning to content marketing to deliver consistent, ongoing, valuable, information to buyers, making them read, think and behave differently.

Without good content you won’t achieve good marketing.

<strong>Copy that moves your conversation to a more personal level – their inbox.</strong>

Research by Microsoft has shown that the steady growth of smartphones has caused the attention span of the human brain to fall as low as 8 seconds, even less than the average goldfish. This means that having great copy content in your email campaigns is more important than ever to capture your customers interest immediately, from eye-catching subject lines to email content that’s concise, informative, engaging and focused on the reader, encouraging them to click through to your website or take action straight from your email.

With the amount of emails we receive on a daily basis into our inbox, standing out from the rest is essential, that’s why having a killer subject line is key to grabbing the attention of the reader and enticing them to open your email.

With our email software we can provide a collection of reports that will analysis your email campaigns, click through rate and open rate, meaning we can refine the copy content to maximise the reach.
